### vocabulary
【微观解析】in part宾语从句中的状语，for whom modern medicine has prolonged the physical agony of dying.定语从句修饰patients; 定语从句还原为一个独立的句子就是：Modern medicine has prolonged the physical agony of dying for them. 这个句子中的them 和前面句子中的patients 为相同名词，因此在这里作者将其写成了一个定语从句，但是在翻译的时候是要分译的。

这句话在定语从句的前世和今生：

suicide debate has been fueled in part by the despair of patients.

The modern medicine has prolonged the physical agony of dying for them.

(两个句子中出现了共有的名词patients 和 them,于是them 被换成了whom ；for whom 一并提前。)
